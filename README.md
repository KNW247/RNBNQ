# Rusty Nut Brew 'n Que â€“ Static Site

This repository powers [RustyNutBrewNQue.com](https://RustyNutBrewNQue.com), a no-fluff homebrewing resource for competitive and small-footprint brewers who want real-world solutions, not theories. This site compiles everything I use â€” from keg dosing techniques to brew day workflows â€” tested in my 10Ã—15 garage brewery, where Iâ€™ve brewed 158 beers across 47 styles in 37 competitions and earned medals in 45% of entries.

Whether you're looking for gear that works, videos that teach, or tools to sharpen your BJCP scoresheet skills, this is where you'll find the processes and resources that get results.
