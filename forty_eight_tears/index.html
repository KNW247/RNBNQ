  <h1>Forty-Eight Tears: The Beer</h1>

  <h2>Crafted with Purpose</h2>
  <p>I began brewing in July of 2021 with the intent to create a beer in honor of my dear friend, Forty-Eight. Over the course of a year, I painstakingly crafted the recipe, embedding meaningful dates and numbers into every step. The date of 48's passing, 11-10, became my target gravity of 1.110. I incorporated 48% of this, 0.48 kg of that, and 111.0 ml of the other, ensuring each element was purposeful.</p>

  <h2>A Collaborative Journey</h2>
  <p>As the recipe took shape, I joined "The Brü Club," an online brewing group, to collaborate on an imperial stout for a series called Average Brü, later featured on The Brülosophy Podcast. Their recipe matched my vision perfectly, and it became the final piece of the puzzle. The beer was brewed in November 2022, exactly eight years after 48’s passing, marking a poignant moment in this tribute's journey.</p>

  <h2>Accolades and Recognition</h2>
  <p>2024 marked my first year of competing more seriously, and <em>Forty-Eight Tears</em> played a pivotal role in my strategy. The beer had an outstanding debut, earning 5 Gold medals from prestigious events like the California Homebrew Competition, Romancing the Beers, Pacific Brewers Cup, Ozark Open Season, and Hot n' Humid. It also garnered 3 Silver medals at Between the Bluffs, Big Beer & Belgian, and the Southern California Regional Homebrew Competition, plus a Bronze at the Ash Copper State Cup. The pinnacle was being named Best of Show at CHC.</p>

  <h2>A Flavorful Tribute</h2>
  <p>This imperial stout, infused with toasted coconut, cocoa nibs, and pecans, evokes the flavors of German chocolate cake. Every sip is a tribute to 48—a celebration of life, love, and the memories shared through the art of brewing.</p>
