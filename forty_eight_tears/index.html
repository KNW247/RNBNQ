    <h1>Forty-Eight Tears: The Beer</h1>

    <h2>Crafted with Purpose</h2>
    <p>I began brewing in July of 2021 with the intent to create a beer in honor of my dear friend, Jeff Mee (AKA 48). Jeff earned the nickname “48” during the Mr. Vegas competition at Bike Fest, after the crowd began chanting his number when they realized the judges had chosen a male stripper over his spontaneous “I rode in and jumped on the stage” performance. The name stuck, and so did the memory of his larger-than-life presence.</p>
    <p>Over the course of a year, I painstakingly crafted the recipe, embedding meaningful dates and numbers into every step. The date of Jeff’s passing, 11-10, became my target gravity of 1.110. I incorporated 48% of this, 0.48 kg of that, and 111.0 ml of the other, ensuring each element was intentional. Every detail was chosen as a quiet nod to his memory.</p>

    <h2>A Collaborative Journey</h2>
    <p>As the recipe took shape, I joined "The Brü Club," an online brewing group, to collaborate on an imperial stout for a series called Average Brü, later featured on <em>The Brülosophy Podcast</em>. Their recipe matched my vision perfectly, and it became the final piece of the puzzle. The beer was brewed in November 2022, exactly eight years after Jeff (48) Mee’s passing — a deliberate choice marking a meaningful milestone in this tribute’s journey.</p>

    <h2>Accolades and Recognition</h2>
    <p>2024 marked my first year of competing more seriously, and <em>Forty-Eight Tears</em> played a pivotal role in my strategy. The beer had an outstanding debut, earning 5 Gold medals from prestigious events like the California Homebrew Competition, Romancing the Beers, Pacific Brewers Cup, Ozark Open Season, and Hot n' Humid. It also garnered 3 Silver medals at Between the Bluffs, Big Beer &amp; Belgian, and the Southern California Regional Homebrew Competition, plus a Bronze at the Ash Copper State Cup. The pinnacle was being named Best of Show at CHC.</p>

    <h2>A Flavorful Tribute</h2>
    <p>This imperial stout, infused with toasted coconut, cocoa nibs, and pecans, evokes the flavors of German chocolate cake. Every sip is a tribute to Jeff (48) Mee — a celebration of life, love, friendship, and the moments that still make us smile. Brewing it allowed me to keep his memory alive in the best way I know how: by sharing it.</p>
